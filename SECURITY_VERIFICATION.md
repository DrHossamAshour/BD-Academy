# BigDentist Security Implementation Verification

This script verifies that all security measures are properly implemented.

## ✅ Implemented Security Features

### 1. CORS Configuration
- ✅ Environment-specific CORS policies
- ✅ Origin validation for API endpoints  
- ✅ Security headers (XSS, content type, frame options)
- ✅ Content Security Policy implementation
- ✅ HTTPS enforcement for production

### 2. Rate Limiting
- ✅ In-memory rate limiting with configurable windows
- ✅ Different limits for auth (5/15min), payments (10/hour), API (100/15min)
- ✅ Client IP detection with proxy support
- ✅ Automatic cleanup of expired entries
- ✅ Rate limit headers in responses

### 3. Input Sanitization
- ✅ XSS prevention with DOMPurify
- ✅ MongoDB injection protection
- ✅ Field-specific sanitization functions
- ✅ HTML tag and attribute filtering
- ✅ URL validation and sanitization

### 4. Authentication Security
- ✅ Stronger password hashing (14 salt rounds)
- ✅ Input sanitization in auth routes
- ✅ Proper error handling
- ✅ Session security with NextAuth.js

### 5. Middleware Security
- ✅ Global security middleware
- ✅ Route-based protection
- ✅ Preflight request handling
- ✅ Security wrapper for API routes

### 6. Next.js Security Headers
- ✅ Security headers in next.config.js
- ✅ API route cache control
- ✅ DNS prefetch control
- ✅ Permissions policy

## 🔧 Files Modified/Created

### New Security Files
